<b>Space Scientist App #Privacy policy</b>
<hr>

Welcome to the Space Scientist app for Android.

I too take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not created this app to collect any personally identifiable information. This app is created to share the vast information related to space science in a manner useful to all. This app only collect app activity as data to improve the app content and performance.

Thanks.


Also to mention, this Android app uses the Admob SDK by Google in order to display ads.

Admob may be using mobile identifier and may use third-party providers to deliver personalised ads.

Admob may collects your approximate location, your app interactions, diagnostic information and a device identifier.

Again to mention, the app itself does not otherwise share any information with anyone.


Yours sincerely,
Ajit Sinha
